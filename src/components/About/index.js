            <p className='about'>
                I am an aspiring software developer, and I just completed the Full Stack Web Developer Boot Camp through the University of Texas.  I have 4+ years of management experience in the transportation industry, and I am ready to explore opportunities in the world of technology and software programming.  My career so far has required me to think critically and make decisions in high-stress situations, and also to be responsible for all facets of the operations to which I was assigned.  I believe that my experience so far has given me the tools necessary to succeed in any work environment, and I am ready for the next challenge that comes my way!
